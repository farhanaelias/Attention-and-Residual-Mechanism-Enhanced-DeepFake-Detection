# 🎭 Attention-and-Residual-Mechanism-Enhanced-DeepFake-Detection

**ARC-Net** is a novel deep learning architecture designed for highly accurate DeepFake detection. It enhances feature representation through **attention** and **residual connections** built upon the **EfficientNetB0** backbone. This repository presents a comprehensive DeepFake detection pipeline evaluated on multiple datasets, including 500 real-world South Asian faces.
